Write a program that addresses the following problem: there are 2 barbers (each a thread) and 10 clients
(each of which are threads).  The clients enter the barbershop at random intervals.  If either barber is
free a client will take a haircut (this takes some random amount of time).  If both barbers are busy the
client sits on the couch and waits.  As soon as a barber is free a client gets a haircut. At each stage
you should have an output (sout) that says what is going on (each client should say when he is waiting,
when he is getting a haircut and when he is done).   We don’t need to impose an order on the threads.
We are NOT (NOT, NOT, NOT) using any of the various types of locks or similar classes that do all the
work for us. No thread-pools.  No using synchronize. Please write a paragraph explaining how you solved
the various “problems” that came up and the approach you took. Give one sample run of the code (show the
output with the printed code).
